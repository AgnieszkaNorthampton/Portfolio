                <section class="section1"><h2> Web design and development beginning</h2>
                <p>Let's start at the beginning. Before I began my studies at Northampton University, I had no prior experience with programming languages. Just a few weeks ago, I learned what HTML and CSS were and began designing and developing my website. After listening to the lectures and practicing my strengths during the practical sessions, I was assured there is nothing difficult about it and that I will do just fine when it comes to developing my website. Little did I know how wrong I was.</p></section>
                <section class="section2"><h2>First steps in developing a website</h2><p>When I first tried to form something which looked like a website, I got all prepared. I read all the module materials several times and tried all the practical exercises, thinking it would only take a few minutes as it all seemed easy. The first thing I created was an index and contact pages, and instead of a few minutes, it took me forever. I had to keep changing the code, nothing was working properly. It was then that I realized it was not going to be an easy ride at all.</p></section>
                <section class="section3"><h2>Thoughts about the whole experience</h2><p>Now that I have completed building my website, I can honestly say you need hours of practice to be able to create a good website that works properly with no errors in the code.</p></section>
