                <h2>My Web designing and developing adventure</h2>
                <p>Lets start from the beginning. Before I started my journey at Northampton university, I had no prior knowledge of any programming languages. A few weeks ago, I got to know what HTML and CSS are and started my adventure of designing and developing a website. When I listened to the lectures and tried my strengths on exercises in the practical sessions, I was sure it was not difficult at all and I’ll be perfectly fine when the time comes to develop my website, and at that time I wasn’t aware how wrong I was.</p>
                <p>On the first day of trying to form something which would look like a website, I got all prepared. I read all the module materials several times I went through all the exercises from the practical sessions and thought it will only take a few moments as it all seems so easy. I started with an index and contact pages and instead of a few moments, it took me forever. I had to keep changing the code nothing was working as supposed to. This is when I realized that it was not going to be an easy ride at all.</p>
                <p>Now when I am at the end of developing my website, I can honestly say you need hours of practice to be able to design and develop a good website with no mistakes in the code. </p>
