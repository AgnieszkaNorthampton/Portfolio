            <h2> My website design and development report </h2>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>I took my first web development class seven weeks ago. My first step towards developing my website was to study hard until I learned how to create a layout of my site using a grid, or how to create a responsive website using hamburger icon and moving menu, as well as how to create a contact form. I started my portfolio website once I had all the necessary information.</p>
            <h3>Website Developement Process</h3>
            <p>Initially, I designed my website on a piece of paper to see what it would look like.  To be more accessible for users, I have placed the menu at the top of the page. I chose blue and grey as the colours for my website because they remind me of modern technology and computers, and they coordinate very well together. I then began developing my website. I have encountered many problems along the way. I spent a long time on the contact page, trying to expand the contact box and connect my email to the contact form but was unable to do so. <img class="contactpage" src="contactpage.jpg" alt="contact page"> Making my website responsive also was a challenge. There were also many happy moments when I managed to create a grid layout on the first try or insert images and cut them to a suitable size.</p>
            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>As a whole, I am pleased with what I have accomplished after just seven weeks of studying web development with no prior knowledge. I am aware that my website is very basic, and I need more knowledge and practice in order to create a professional-looking website, but we all have to start somewhere. Through the development of this website, I learned many valuable skills that will help me in my future studies and career.</p>
